This is the [repository](https://github.com/PatternRec2020/PatPat2020/) for our solutions to the group exercises. Create a folder for each new exercise.
## Start Guide
Use jupyter notebook to edit the .ipynb file. Version of python : 3.7.4

### For 2a, 2b, 2c
 In the dataset folder:
 * create a subfolder named "csv" and put all the required csv dataset. 
 * create a subfolder named "png" and put all the required png dataset.
 ### For 2d
 In the dataset folder, unzip the file mnist-permutated-png-format. It should create a folder called `mnist-permutated-png-format`
